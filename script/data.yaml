introduction:
  - I joined the Visual Computing Group of Microsoft Research Asia in late 2017.
  - Before that, I received both my B.S and PhD degrees from the School of Software, Tsinghua University.
    My research interests include but are not limited to the understanding and synthesis of faces and 3D.
